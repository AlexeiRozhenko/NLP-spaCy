# NLP-spaCy
Fake or Real? Let's see!

When I completed the spaCy library course, I really wanted to try out my knowledge in practice. Therefore, I chose the dataset concerning the real or fake news prediction and tried out classical ML algorithm, CatBoost, with a text embedding to make accurate forecasts. 

**The logic of my project is the following:**
1.	Some EDA to get acquainted with the data
2.	Text cleaning (removing stop words, punctuation and uppercase)
3.	Data preprocessing (text embedding using spaCy, splitting into train and test)
4.	Modeling using CatBoost

**The result:**
The obtained accuracy of CatBoost was 92 and 91 for training and testing, respectively. 

**The schematic of the project:**
